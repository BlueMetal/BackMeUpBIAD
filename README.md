  * Integrating the bot into the .Net Core ecosystem
  * Build robust data collection using dialogs
* QnA Maker
  * Create a new knowledge base using the QnA Maker website
  * Integrate a bot with the QnA Maker API
  * Enhance the knowledge base with natural banter (chitchat)
* Language Understanding
  * Configure the Azure Language Understanding (LUIS) service to recognize intents
  * Incorporate entities into intents to collect data from natural language utterances  
  * Integrate a bot with LUIS
  * Respond to intents in the bot
  * Perform continuous improvement on the LUIS application

These labs use .Net Core 2.1 with the 4.x Bot Framework dependencies.
