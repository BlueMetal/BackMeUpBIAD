# Lab 3: LUIS Integration

## Abstract

The Language Understanding (LUIS) API allows you to take advantage of the deep learning capabilities of Azureâ€™s Cognitive Services to incorporate natural language interactions into your bot. This lab focuses on configuring and integrating LUIS into our BackMeUp bot.

Upon completion, developers should have:

* Set up a LUIS application
* Connect the bot service to LUIS
* Manage synonyms with entities
* Use intents to tie utterances to dialogs or steps
* Test and release LUIS application using versions
* Continuously improve your LUIS app
